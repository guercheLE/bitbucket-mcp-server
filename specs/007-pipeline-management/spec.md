# Feature 007: Pipeline Management

## Overview
Implement comprehensive pipeline management capabilities for Bitbucket repositories, enabling users to create, configure, monitor, and manage CI/CD pipelines through MCP tools.

## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Pipeline Creation and Configuration
**As a** developer
**I want to** create and configure CI/CD pipelines for my repository
**So that** I can automate build, test, and deployment processes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create new pipelines with configurable settings
- Configure pipeline triggers (push, pull request, manual)
- Set up build environments and dependencies
- Define pipeline steps and workflows
- Configure notifications and alerts

### Scenario 2: Pipeline Monitoring and Status
**As a** project manager
**I want to** monitor pipeline execution status and performance
**So that** I can track build health and identify issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- View pipeline execution history
- Monitor real-time pipeline status
- Track build metrics and performance
- Receive notifications on pipeline failures
- Access detailed build logs and artifacts

### Scenario 3: Pipeline Management and Maintenance
**As a** DevOps engineer
**I want to** manage and maintain pipeline configurations
**So that** I can optimize build processes and ensure reliability

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Update pipeline configurations
- Manage pipeline permissions and access
- Handle pipeline failures and retries
- Archive and cleanup old pipelines
- Manage pipeline variables and secrets

## Functional Requirements

### Core Pipeline Operations
- **Pipeline Creation**: Create new pipelines with configurable settings
- **Pipeline Configuration**: Set up triggers, environments, and workflows
- **Pipeline Execution**: Start, stop, and restart pipeline runs
- **Pipeline Monitoring**: Track status, progress, and performance metrics

### Pipeline Management
- **Pipeline Updates**: Modify existing pipeline configurations
- **Pipeline Permissions**: Manage access control and user permissions
- **Pipeline Variables**: Handle environment variables and secrets
- **Pipeline Artifacts**: Manage build artifacts and outputs

### Pipeline Integration
- **Repository Integration**: Link pipelines to specific repositories
- **Branch Integration**: Configure branch-specific pipeline behaviors
- **Webhook Integration**: Set up automated pipeline triggers
- **Notification Integration**: Configure alerts and notifications

## Key Entities

### Pipeline
- **ID**: Unique pipeline identifier
- **Name**: Human-readable pipeline name
- **Repository**: Associated repository
- **Configuration**: Pipeline settings and parameters
- **Status**: Current pipeline state
- **Triggers**: Automated trigger configurations
- **Permissions**: Access control settings

### Pipeline Run
- **ID**: Unique run identifier
- **Pipeline**: Associated pipeline
- **Status**: Execution status (running, success, failed, cancelled)
- **Start Time**: When the run started
- **Duration**: Total execution time
- **Logs**: Build and execution logs
- **Artifacts**: Generated build artifacts
- **Trigger**: What triggered this run

### Pipeline Step
- **ID**: Unique step identifier
- **Name**: Step name and description
- **Type**: Step type (build, test, deploy, etc.)
- **Configuration**: Step-specific settings
- **Status**: Step execution status
- **Duration**: Step execution time
- **Output**: Step results and outputs
