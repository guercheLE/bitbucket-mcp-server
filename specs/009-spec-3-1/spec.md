# Feature Specification: Maintenance & Updates

**Feature Branch**: `009-spec-3-1`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "### Spec 3.1: Maintenance & Updates
*   **FRs:**
    *   Develop a process for re-generating embeddings and updating internal operations when new Bitbucket API versions are released.
    *   Perform regular updates of all third-party dependencies.
*   **NFRs:**
    *   **Security:** Continuously monitor for security vulnerabilities in dependencies using tools like \`npm audit\`.
    *   **Reliability:** Monitor production metrics to maintain >99.9% uptime."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors (maintainer), actions (update, monitor, re-generate), data (embeddings, metrics), constraints (security, reliability)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a maintainer, I want to have a clear and automated process to keep the MCP server up-to-date with both Bitbucket API changes and third-party library updates, ensuring security and reliability.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new Bitbucket API version is released, **When** the maintenance process for embeddings is run, **Then** new vector embeddings are generated and packaged for distribution.
2. **Given** that third-party dependencies are outdated, **When** the dependency update process is executed, **Then** all dependencies are updated to their latest non-breaking versions.
3. **Given** the system is integrated with a CI/CD pipeline, **When** a dependency with a known critical vulnerability is introduced, **Then** the pipeline build fails and an alert is logged.
4. **Given** the server is running in a production environment, **When** its uptime drops below 99.9% over a defined period, **Then** an alert is sent to the maintenance team.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a Bitbucket API change is backward-incompatible? The process should flag this for manual intervention.
- How does the system handle a dependency update that introduces breaking changes? The update process should fail safely and report the problematic dependency.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: How should the system locate the latest Bitbucket API documentation for re-generating embeddings? → A: From a specific, stable URL where the documentation is always published. (https://developer.atlassian.com)
- Q: What is the expected frequency for running the dependency update process? → A: On a fixed schedule (e.g., weekly, monthly).
- Q: When a backward-incompatible Bitbucket API change is detected, how should the system respond? → A: Halt the embedding generation process and require manual intervention.
- Q: Which specific metrics are essential for monitoring the >99.9% uptime NFR? → A: Health check success, latency.
- Q: How should the dependency update process handle major version updates that likely contain breaking changes? → A: Exclude them completely, requiring manual updates for all major versions.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a script or automated process to re-generate vector embeddings by fetching content from a stable, predefined URL (https://developer.atlassian.com). The process must halt and alert for manual intervention if a backward-incompatible API change is detected.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST have a defined process for updating internal tool operations when the Bitbucket API changes.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST include a mechanism (e.g., a script or CI job) to regularly check for and apply updates to all third-party dependencies on a fixed schedule (e.g., weekly). This process MUST exclude major version updates, which require manual review and implementation.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST integrate a tool into the CI/CD pipeline to continuously monitor for security vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST expose production metrics to monitor uptime and other key performance indicators.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: **Security:** The dependency vulnerability scanning process MUST be configured to fail the build if critical vulnerabilities are detected.
- **NFR-002**: **Reliability:** The production monitoring system MUST track health check success rate and API latency to ensure >99.9% uptime and alert maintainers if this threshold is breached.
