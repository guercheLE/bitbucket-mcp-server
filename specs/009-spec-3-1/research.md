# Research: Maintenance & Updates

## Research Summary

This document outlines the research findings for implementing the maintenance and update features for the Bitbucket MCP Server. The focus is on establishing robust, automated processes for dependency management, embedding regeneration, and system monitoring.

### 1. Dependency Update Automation

**Decision**: Use `npm-check-updates` for checking and updating dependencies, and `npm audit` for vulnerability scanning.

**Rationale**:

- `npm-check-updates` is a well-established tool that provides fine-grained control over how dependencies are updated. It can be configured to ignore major versions, which aligns with our requirement to handle breaking changes manually.
- `npm audit` is the standard, built-in mechanism for checking for security vulnerabilities in Node.js projects. It can be configured to fail a CI build if vulnerabilities of a certain severity are found, which is a critical security gate.
- Both tools are scriptable and can be easily integrated into a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run on a schedule.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **Dependabot/Renovate**: While powerful, they are often better for repository-level automation with pull requests. Our requirement is for a scriptable process that can be run as part of a larger maintenance workflow, making `npm-check-updates` a better fit for direct control.
- **Third-party security scanners (Snyk, etc.)**: These offer more advanced features but introduce another third-party dependency. For our current needs, `npm audit` is sufficient and aligns with keeping the toolchain simple.

### 2. Resilient Embedding Generation Pipeline

**Decision**: Develop a script that fetches the API documentation from the specified URL, computes a checksum of the content, and compares it against a stored checksum. If the checksums differ, the embedding generation process is triggered.

**Rationale**:

- **Checksum Comparison**: This is a simple and effective way to detect any change in the upstream documentation. It's lightweight and avoids the need to parse the entire documentation just to check for changes.
- **Manual Intervention on Failure**: The process will be designed to halt and log an error if the documentation URL is unreachable or if the content appears to be malformed (e.g., empty or significantly smaller than expected). This provides a safety net against upstream issues.
- **Backward-incompatible change detection**: While a checksum detects _any_ change, it cannot semantically determine if a change is backward-incompatible. The spec correctly defers this to manual intervention. The script will log the change and notify maintainers, but will not proceed automatically, as per the clarification.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **ETag/Last-Modified Headers**: Relying on HTTP headers is an option, but not all servers implement them reliably. A content-based checksum is more robust.
- **Semantic Diffing**: Tools to semantically compare HTML or API specifications exist, but they add significant complexity. A simple checksum is sufficient to trigger the process, and manual review is required for incompatible changes anyway.

### 3. Application Health and Uptime Monitoring

**Decision**: Implement a dedicated `/health` endpoint in the MCP server and use `prom-client` to expose key metrics for Prometheus.

**Rationale**:

- **`/health` endpoint**: This is a standard pattern for service health checks. It can be used by load balancers, container orchestrators (like Kubernetes), and monitoring systems to determine if the service is alive and ready to accept traffic. The check can be as simple as verifying database connectivity.
- **`prom-client`**: This is the official and most popular Node.js client for Prometheus. It makes it easy to create and expose custom metrics, such as API latency, error rates, and request throughput.
- **Prometheus/Grafana Stack**: This is a very common, powerful, and open-source stack for metrics collection and visualization. By exposing metrics in the Prometheus format, we make the server easily integrable with industry-standard monitoring tools.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **Push-based metrics (StatsD, etc.)**: While also a valid approach, the pull-based model of Prometheus is often simpler to set up and manage, especially for services that are already exposing an HTTP interface.
- **Custom Logging for Metrics**: Relying on parsing logs to extract metrics is brittle and less efficient than exposing a dedicated metrics endpoint.
