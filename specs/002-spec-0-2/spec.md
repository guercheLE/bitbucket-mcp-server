# Feature Specification: Core Component Design & Test Definition

**Feature Branch**: `002-spec-0-2`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "### Spec 0.2: Core Component Design & Test Definition

- **FRs:**
  - Write a detailed design document for the 3-tool semantic discovery pattern (`search-ids`, `get-id`, `call-id`).
  - Write the test specifications for all MVP features. This involves creating the Jest test files with `describe` and `it` blocks for:
    1.  Server startup and transport connectivity.
    2.  Bitbucket server detection and authentication.
    3.  The three core tools (`search-ids`, `get-id`, `call-id`).
- **NFRs:**
  - **Approval:** These test specifications **must be reviewed and approved by the Project Lead** before any implementation code is written, fulfilling the ""Tests written â†’ Project Lead approved"" mandate."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer, I want to define the core components and test specifications for the Bitbucket MCP server so that I can ensure the MVP features are well-designed and testable before implementation begins.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the need for a semantic discovery pattern, **When** the design document for the 3-tool pattern (`search-ids`, `get-id`, `call-id`) is written, **Then** the document clearly outlines the functionality and interaction of these tools.
2. **Given** the MVP features for the Bitbucket MCP server, **When** the Jest test files are created, **Then** `describe` and `it` blocks exist for server startup, Bitbucket server detection/authentication, and the three core tools.
3. **Given** the created test specifications, **When** they are submitted for review, **Then** the Project Lead can approve them.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the design document for the semantic discovery pattern is incomplete?
- What happens if the test specifications do not cover all MVP features?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: A detailed design document for the 3-tool semantic discovery pattern (`search-ids`, `get-id`, `call-id`) MUST be created.
- **FR-002**: Jest test files with `describe` and `it` blocks MUST be created for server startup and transport connectivity.
- **FR-003**: Jest test files with `describe` and `it` blocks MUST be created for Bitbucket server detection and authentication.
- **FR-004**: Jest test files with `describe` and `it` blocks MUST be created for the three core tools (`search-ids`, `get-id`, `call-id`).

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: The test specifications MUST be reviewed and approved by the Project Lead before any implementation code is written.
