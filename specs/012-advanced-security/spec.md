# Specification 012: Advanced Security

## Overview

This specification implements advanced security features for the Bitbucket MCP Server, including enhanced authentication, authorization, security monitoring, and compliance features.

## Objectives

1. **Enhanced Authentication & Authorization**
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Advanced session management
   - Token lifecycle management

2. **Security Monitoring & Auditing**
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Security event monitoring
   - Threat detection and alerting
   - Compliance reporting

3. **Data Protection & Privacy**
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit
   - Sensitive data masking
   - GDPR compliance features
   - Data retention policies

4. **Security Hardening**
   - Rate limiting and DoS protection
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Security headers implementation
   - Vulnerability scanning integration

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All authentication flows support MFA
- [ ] Complete audit trail for all operations
