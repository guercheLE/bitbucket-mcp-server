# Research: Console Client & User Experience

## 1. Core Technology Stack

*   **Decision**: The console client will be built using Node.js, TypeScript, and the `commander.js` library.
*   **Rationale**:
    *   This stack aligns perfectly with the existing project technologies and the requirements outlined in both the feature specification and the project constitution.
    *   `commander.js` is explicitly required and is the de-facto standard for building robust command-line interfaces in the Node.js ecosystem.
    *   TypeScript will ensure type safety when interacting with the server's dynamic capabilities.
*   **Alternatives Considered**:
    *   `yargs`: Another popular CLI library, but `commander.js` is already specified.
    *   Plain `process.argv`: This would require significant boilerplate for parsing commands, arguments, and options, which `commander.js` handles out-of-the-box.

## 2. Server Capability Discovery

*   **Decision**: The client will discover server capabilities by calling a built-in MCP tool on the server, tentatively named `get-capabilities`. This tool is expected to return a list of available `ServerCapability` objects.
*   **Rationale**:
    *   Using an MCP tool for discovery ensures that the client adheres to the MCP-first principle of the constitution. It treats the server as a black box and interacts via the standard protocol.
    *   This approach decouples the client from the server's internal implementation. The server can add, remove, or modify tools without requiring a client-side update, as long as the `get-capabilities` contract is maintained.
*   **Alternatives Considered**:
    *   **Static Configuration File**: Shipping the client with a file listing all possible commands. This is inflexible, violates the dynamic registration requirement, and would create a tight coupling between client and server versions.
    *   **Hardcoding Endpoints**: Directly calling a non-MCP HTTP endpoint. This violates the MCP-first principle.

## 3. Client-Server Communication

*   **Decision**: The client will use the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to communicate with the server, primarily over an HTTP transport. An `axios`-based transport will be implemented within the SDK's framework.
*   **Rationale**:
    *   The official SDK is mandated by the constitution and provides the necessary abstractions for MCP communication.
    *   HTTP is a standard, robust transport suitable for the request-response nature of CLI commands. The server is already required to support it.
*   **Alternatives Considered**:
    *   **stdio transport**: While viable and supported, it's better suited for tightly integrated parent-child processes. An independent CLI benefits from the flexibility of network-based communication like HTTP.

## 4. Documentation Generation

*   **Decision**: User documentation will be created as Markdown files in the `/docs` directory.
*   **Rationale**:
    *   This fulfills the non-functional requirement from the feature specification.
    *   Markdown is easy to write, version-control, and can be rendered effectively in Git repositories and static site generators.
*   **Alternatives Considered**: None, as this is a direct requirement.
