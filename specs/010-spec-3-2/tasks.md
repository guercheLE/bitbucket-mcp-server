# Tasks: Console Client & User Experience

This document outlines the development tasks for implementing the console client, based on the design artifacts in this directory.

## Task List

| ID | Task Description | File(s) | Depends On | Status |
|----|------------------|---------|------------|--------|
| **Phase 0: Setup & Configuration** |
| T001 | Install `commander.js` dependency | `package.json` | - | [X] Completed |
| T002 | Create client directory structure | `src/client/`, `tests/integration/client/`, `tests/unit/client/` | - | [X] Completed |
| **Phase 1: Test Definition (TDD)** |
| T003 | **Test [P]**: Create integration test for basic client invocation and help output | `tests/integration/client/help.test.ts` | T002 | [X] Completed |
| T004 | **Test [P]**: Create integration test for dynamic command discovery | `tests/integration/client/discovery.test.ts` | T002 | [X] Completed |
| T005 | **Test [P]**: Create integration test for the end-to-end semantic workflow | `tests/integration/client/workflow.test.ts` | T002 | [X] Completed |
| T006 | **Test [P]**: Create unit test for mapping server capabilities to client commands | `tests/unit/client/mapper.test.ts` | T002 | [X] Completed |
| **Phase 2: Core Implementation** |
| T007 | **Impl**: Create the main CLI entry point with basic `commander.js` setup | `src/client/index.ts` | T001, T003 | [X] Completed |
| T008 | **Impl**: Implement a service to connect to the MCP server and fetch capabilities | `src/client/mcp-service.ts` | T004 | [X] Completed |
| T009 | **Impl**: Implement the logic to map server capabilities to `commander.js` commands | `src/client/command-mapper.ts` | T006, T008 | Not Started |
| T010 | **Impl**: Integrate the service and mapper into the main entry point to dynamically register commands | `src/client/index.ts` | T007, T009 | Not Started |
| T011 | **Impl**: Implement the action handlers for the dynamic commands to execute them via the MCP service | `src/client/index.ts` | T005, T010 | Not Started |
| **Phase 3: Documentation & Polish** |
| T012 | **Docs**: Create user documentation for the console client and semantic workflow | `docs/console-client-usage.md` | T011 | Not Started |
| T013 | **Polish**: Implement error handling for connection failures and invalid commands | `src/client/index.ts`, `src/client/mcp-service.ts` | T011 | Not Started |
| T014 | **Polish**: Final review, run all tests, and ensure all acceptance criteria are met | All | T012, T013 | Not Started |

## Parallel Execution Guide

Tasks marked with **[P]** can be executed in parallel to accelerate development.

### Wave 1: Initial Tests

The following test creation tasks can be performed simultaneously as they do not depend on each other.

```bash
# Terminal 1
/task T003 "Create integration test for basic client invocation and help output"

# Terminal 2
/task T004 "Create integration test for dynamic command discovery"

# Terminal 3
/task T005 "Create integration test for the end-to-end semantic workflow"

# Terminal 4
/task T006 "Create unit test for mapping server capabilities to client commands"
```

Once the initial tests are defined, the implementation can proceed, following the dependency chain outlined in the task list.
