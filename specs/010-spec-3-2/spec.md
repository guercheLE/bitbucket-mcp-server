# Feature Specification: Console Client & User Experience

**Feature Branch**: `010-spec-3-2`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "### Spec 3.2: Console Client & User Experience

- **FRs:**
  - Implement the built-in console client using `commander.js`.
  - Implement selective command registration in the client based on the connected server's detected capabilities.
- **NFRs:**
  - **Documentation:** Create comprehensive user documentation in `/docs` with practical examples for common administrative and development tasks using the semantic discovery workflow."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (developer/admin), actions (run commands, view help), data (server capabilities), constraints (selective registration)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25

- Q: How should the client behave if the connection to the server is lost _during_ a command execution?
  - A: Attempt to reconnect once; if it fails, terminate with an error.
- Q: How should the client handle a situation where it cannot connect to the server _at all_ upon startup?
  - A: Exit immediately with a "server not found" error.
- Q: When the client's available commands are displayed (e.g., via --help), how should they be sorted?
  - A: Alphabetically by command name.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer or administrator, I want a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the Bitbucket MCP Server, so I can easily perform tasks and automate workflows without needing a graphical user interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the server is running, **When** a user runs the console client with a help flag (e.g., `--help`), **Then** they see a list of available commands and their descriptions.
2. **Given** the client is connected to a server, **When** the user runs a command that the server supports (e.g., `search-ids`), **Then** the command executes successfully and returns the expected output to the console.
3. **Given** the client is connected to a server, **When** the user attempts to run a command that the server does not support, **Then** the client shows a clear error message indicating the command is not available for the connected server.
4. **Given** a user wants to learn about the system, **When** they look in the `/docs` directory, **Then** they find comprehensive documentation with practical examples for using the console client and the semantic discovery workflow.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the connection to the server is lost during a command execution? The client will attempt to reconnect once. If the reconnection fails, it will terminate the command and display a connection error message.
- How does the client handle invalid arguments or flags for a registered command?
- How does the client behave when it cannot connect to the server at all? The client will exit immediately with a "server not found" error message.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a console client executable for interaction.
- **FR-002**: The client MUST be able to connect to a running Bitbucket MCP Server instance.
- **FR-003**: The client MUST query the connected server to discover its available capabilities (i.e., tools/commands).
- **FR-004**: The client MUST dynamically register and expose only the commands supported by the connected server.
- **FR-005**: The client MUST provide a standard help interface (e.g., a `--help` flag) that lists all currently registered commands and their purposes.
- **FR-006**: The command list in the help interface MUST be sorted alphabetically by command name.
- **FR-007**: The client MUST correctly format and send user-provided arguments to the server for command execution.
- **FR-008**: The client MUST display the output or any errors returned from the server to the user's console.
- **FR-009**: The project MUST include comprehensive user documentation in the `/docs` directory, detailing the setup and use of the console client and providing examples of the semantic discovery workflow (`search-ids`, `get-id`, `call-id`).
