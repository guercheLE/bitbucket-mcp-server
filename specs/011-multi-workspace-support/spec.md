## Feature ID
011-multi-workspace-support

## Feature Name
Multi-Workspace Support

## Version
1.0.0

## Status
ðŸ“‹ Specification Phase

## Overview

This feature enables the Bitbucket MCP Server to manage and interact with multiple Bitbucket workspaces simultaneously, providing workspace-aware operations, cross-workspace search capabilities, and unified management interfaces.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Currently, the MCP server operates within a single Bitbucket workspace context. Organizations often have multiple Bitbucket workspaces for different teams, projects, or business units, requiring users to switch contexts manually or run multiple server instances.

### Business Value
- **Operational Efficiency**: Unified interface for managing multiple workspaces
- **Cross-Workspace Insights**: Analytics and search across workspace boundaries  
- **Simplified Architecture**: Single server instance supporting multiple contexts
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Easy discovery and access to resources across workspaces

### Success Metrics
- Support for 10+ concurrent workspaces per server instance
- Cross-workspace operations with <2s response time
- Zero workspace data leakage (complete isolation)
- 95% uptime across all managed workspaces
