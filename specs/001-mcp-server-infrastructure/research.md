# Research Report: MCP Server Infrastructure

**Feature**: 001-mcp-server-infrastructure  
**Date**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Complete  

## Research Findings

### MCP Protocol Implementation
**Decision**: Use official @modelcontextprotocol/sdk (TypeScript)  
**Rationale**: 
- Official SDK ensures protocol compliance
- Built-in Zod schema validation support
- Active maintenance and community support
- TypeScript native for type safety
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Custom MCP implementation (rejected: maintenance burden, compliance risk)
- Python MCP SDK (rejected: constitutional requirement for Node.js/TypeScript)

### Transport Layer Strategy
**Decision**: Implement stdio, HTTP, and SSE transports  
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for multi-transport support
- stdio for CLI integration, HTTP for web clients, SSE for real-time features
- MCP SDK provides transport abstractions
**Alternatives considered**:
- Single transport implementation (rejected: constitutional violation)
- WebSocket transport (deferred: not in MCP core specification)

### Server Architecture Pattern
**Decision**: Event-driven architecture with MCP protocol handlers  
**Rationale**:
- Natural fit for MCP request-response patterns
- Supports concurrent client connections
- Enables tool registration and discovery
- Scalable for multiple Bitbucket API integrations
**Alternatives considered**:
- REST API wrapper (rejected: not MCP compliant)
- gRPC server (rejected: not in MCP specification)

### Tool Registration Strategy
**Decision**: Dynamic tool registration with metadata-driven discovery  
**Rationale**:
- Supports selective registration based on Bitbucket server type/version
- Enables runtime tool availability checking
- Constitutional requirement for selective loading
**Alternatives considered**:
- Static tool registration (rejected: doesn't support selective loading)
- Plugin-based architecture (deferred: adds complexity without immediate benefit)

### Error Handling and Logging
**Decision**: Winston logging with MCP-specific error handling  
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for structured logging
- MCP protocol defines specific error response formats
- Winston provides log sanitization capabilities
**Alternatives considered**:
- Console logging (rejected: insufficient for production)
- Custom logging (rejected: Winston meets all requirements)

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Jest with contract, integration, and unit test layers  
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for Test-First Development
- Contract tests ensure MCP protocol compliance
- Integration tests validate client-server interactions
- Unit tests for tool registration and server lifecycle
**Alternatives considered**:
- Mocha/Chai (rejected: Jest has better TypeScript integration)
- Test-only approach (rejected: must achieve >80% coverage)

## Implementation Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk (latest with Zod support)
- zod (schema validation)
- winston (logging)
- typescript (strict mode)

### Development Dependencies  
- jest (testing framework)
- @types/node (TypeScript definitions)
- ts-jest (TypeScript Jest preset)
- @typescript-eslint/* (linting)

### Architecture Decisions Impact
- Single-process server design supports constitutional requirement for <1GB memory
- Event-driven model enables constitutional requirement for multiple concurrent clients
- Modular tool registration supports constitutional selective loading requirement
- Comprehensive testing strategy addresses constitutional Test-First requirement

## Next Phase Dependencies
All research complete - no blocking unknowns for Phase 1 design work.
