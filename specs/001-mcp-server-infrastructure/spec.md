**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "001-mcp-server-infrastructure"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí "Basic MCP server setup with protocol compliance"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developers, MCP clients
   ‚Üí Actions: Connect, communicate, manage tools
   ‚Üí Data: MCP protocol messages, tool registrations
   ‚Üí Constraints: Protocol compliance, TypeScript implementation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clear based on constitutional requirements
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Client-server connection and tool management scenarios
5. Generate Functional Requirements

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer building applications with AI capabilities, I need a Bitbucket MCP server that implements the Model Context Protocol so that my AI tools can securely interact with Bitbucket repositories, issues, and CI/CD pipelines through standardized interfaces.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an MCP client application, **When** it attempts to connect to the Bitbucket MCP server, **Then** the server establishes a proper MCP protocol connection and responds with available capabilities
2. **Given** a connected MCP client, **When** it requests the list of available tools, **Then** the server provides a complete catalog of Bitbucket-related tools with their schemas
3. **Given** a properly configured server, **When** an MCP client sends protocol-compliant requests, **Then** the server processes them according to MCP specification and returns valid responses
4. **Given** an invalid or malformed request, **When** sent to the server, **Then** the server responds with appropriate error messages following MCP error handling standards

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the server receives non-MCP protocol messages?
- How does the system handle connection timeouts or network interruptions?
- What occurs when tool registration fails due to configuration issues?
- How does the server respond to unsupported MCP protocol versions?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Server MUST implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification for client-server communication
- **FR-002**: Server MUST establish secure connections with MCP clients using standard transport mechanisms
- **FR-003**: Server MUST register and expose Bitbucket-related tools according to MCP tool registration standards
- **FR-004**: Server MUST validate all incoming requests against MCP protocol schemas
- **FR-005**: Server MUST provide proper error handling and status responses per MCP specification
- **FR-006**: Server MUST support graceful startup and shutdown procedures
- **FR-007**: Server MUST log connection events and protocol interactions for debugging and monitoring
- **FR-008**: Server MUST support multiple concurrent client connections
- **FR-009**: Server MUST implement proper MCP capability negotiation with clients
- **FR-010**: Server MUST maintain protocol compliance as the foundation for all Bitbucket integrations

### Key Entities
- **MCP Server**: The main service that implements Model Context Protocol, manages client connections, and hosts Bitbucket tools
- **MCP Client**: External applications that connect to the server to access Bitbucket functionality through the protocol
- **Protocol Message**: Structured data exchanged between client and server following MCP specifications
- **Tool Registration**: The mechanism by which Bitbucket-related capabilities are made available to clients
- **Connection Session**: The stateful communication channel between a client and the server
