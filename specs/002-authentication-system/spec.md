# Feature Specification: Authentication System

**Feature Branch**: `002-authentication-system`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Authentication system for Bitbucket MCP server with OAuth support"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the Bitbucket MCP server, I need to authenticate with my Bitbucket account so that I can securely access my repositories and perform operations through the MCP protocol.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user wants to connect to Bitbucket, **When** they initiate authentication, **Then** they should be redirected to Bitbucket's OAuth authorization page
2. **Given** a user completes OAuth authorization, **When** they return to the MCP server, **Then** they should receive a valid access token
3. **Given** a user has a valid access token, **When** they make MCP requests, **Then** the server should authenticate them using the token
4. **Given** a user's access token expires, **When** they make a request, **Then** the server should automatically refresh the token using the refresh token
5. **Given** a user wants to disconnect, **When** they revoke their session, **Then** all tokens should be invalidated

### Edge Cases
- What happens when OAuth authorization is denied by the user?
- How does the system handle network failures during token refresh?
- What happens when refresh tokens expire or are revoked?
- How does the system handle multiple concurrent authentication requests?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow for Bitbucket authentication
- **FR-002**: System MUST securely store and manage access tokens and refresh tokens
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically refresh expired access tokens using refresh tokens
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate access tokens on each MCP request
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide token revocation functionality for user logout
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle OAuth authorization errors gracefully
- **FR-007**: System MUST support both Bitbucket Data Center and Bitbucket Cloud authentication
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain session state across MCP protocol interactions
- **FR-009**: System MUST log authentication events for security auditing
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle concurrent authentication requests without conflicts

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **OAuth Application**: Represents the registered OAuth app with Bitbucket, containing client ID, client secret, and redirect URI
- **Access Token**: Represents the short-lived token used for API requests, with expiration time and scope information
- **Refresh Token**: Represents the long-lived token used to obtain new access tokens, with expiration and revocation status
- **User Session**: Represents an active authentication session, linking user identity to tokens and session metadata
- **Authentication State**: Represents the current authentication status, including token validity and user permissions
