# Feature Specification: Bitbucket Authentication System

**Feature Branch**: `003-authentication-system`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Bitbucket authentication system supporting OAuth 2.0, App Passwords, API Tokens, and Basic Auth for both Data Center and Cloud environments with MCP tool integration"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: Multi-method authentication system for Bitbucket integration
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developers, applications, Bitbucket servers
   ‚Üí Actions: Authenticate, authorize, manage credentials
   ‚Üí Data: Tokens, credentials, user sessions
   ‚Üí Constraints: Support multiple auth methods, both Cloud and Data Center
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clear from constitutional requirements and Bitbucket docs
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: Configure credentials, authenticate, access APIs
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement supports specific auth method and environment
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Authentication Manager, Credential Store, Token Handler
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No clarifications needed - well-defined authentication patterns
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the Bitbucket MCP server, I need to authenticate with my Bitbucket instance using my preferred authentication method, so that I can securely access repositories and perform operations through MCP tools.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have OAuth 2.0 credentials for Bitbucket Cloud, **When** I configure the MCP server with OAuth tokens, **Then** it successfully authenticates and can access my repositories
2. **Given** I have an App Password for Bitbucket Cloud, **When** I provide username and app password, **Then** the server authenticates and grants appropriate access
3. **Given** I have API tokens for Bitbucket Data Center, **When** I configure the server with API tokens, **Then** it authenticates with the on-premise server
4. **Given** I have basic auth credentials for Bitbucket Data Center, **When** I provide username and password, **Then** the server can authenticate for legacy setups
5. **Given** I switch between different Bitbucket instances, **When** I update authentication configuration, **Then** the server re-authenticates with the new instance

### Edge Cases
- What happens when authentication tokens expire?
- How does the system handle rate limiting from authentication failures?
- How does it handle switching between Cloud and Data Center authentication methods?
- What happens when network connectivity is lost during authentication?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support OAuth 2.0 authentication for Bitbucket Cloud using authorization code flow
- **FR-002**: System MUST support App Password authentication for Bitbucket Cloud with username/password combination
- **FR-003**: System MUST support API Token authentication for Bitbucket Data Center (7.16+) environments
- **FR-004**: System MUST support Basic Authentication for Bitbucket Data Center legacy setups
- **FR-005**: System MUST detect server type (Cloud vs Data Center) and present appropriate authentication options
- **FR-006**: System MUST securely store and manage authentication credentials without exposing them in logs
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle authentication token refresh automatically for OAuth 2.0 flows
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate authentication credentials before attempting API calls
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear error messages for authentication failures with guidance for resolution
- **FR-010**: System MUST support multiple concurrent authentication configurations for different Bitbucket instances
- **FR-011**: System MUST integrate authentication with MCP tools to authorize API requests transparently
- **FR-012**: System MUST respect Bitbucket's rate limiting and implement proper retry mechanisms for auth failures

### Key Entities
- **Authentication Manager**: Coordinates authentication across different methods and manages credential lifecycle
- **Credential Store**: Securely stores and retrieves authentication credentials for different Bitbucket instances
- **Token Handler**: Manages OAuth tokens, refresh cycles, and token validation for Cloud environments
- **Server Detector**: Identifies Bitbucket server type and version to determine available authentication methods
- **Auth Validator**: Validates credentials and tests connectivity before storing authentication configuration
