# Feature Specification: Enterprise Readiness

**Feature Branch**: `008-spec-2-2`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "### Spec 2.2: Enterprise Readiness
*   **FRs:**
    *   Implement all remaining authentication methods (OAuth 2.0) and the priority-based fallback logic.
    *   Implement all remaining transport protocols (SSE, HTTP streaming).
    *   Implement multi-language support using `i18next`.
*   **NFRs:**
    *   **Security:** Implement and test security hardening features: Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, and circuit breakers.
    *   **Observability:** Configure advanced logging (e.g., rotation, shipping) and expose Prometheus metrics for key performance indicators.
    *   **Performance:** Conduct load testing to ensure all SLA metrics defined in the constitution are met."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: For the advanced logging requirement, which log shipping target should be prioritized? → A: Local file with rotation, using common industry-standard policies.
- Q: What is the required priority order for the authentication fallback logic? → A: User-configurable, with a sensible default order.
- Q: The specification requires rate limiting. What should be the scope for this rate limit? → A: Combination (e.g., per IP and per user).
- Q: When the circuit breaker for the Bitbucket API is tripped, what should be the default behavior? → A: Fail fast: immediately reject new requests with an error.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator of a large enterprise, I want the Bitbucket MCP Server to be secure, observable, and robust, supporting industry-standard protocols and authentication methods, so that I can integrate it safely and reliably into our existing infrastructure.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** the server is configured for OAuth 2.0, **When** a client connects, **Then** it successfully authenticates using the OAuth 2.0 flow.
2.  **Given** a client is connected via SSE, **When** a long-running operation emits events, **Then** the client receives these events in real-time.
3.  **Given** the server is under high load, **When** the rate limit is exceeded, **Then** subsequent requests are gracefully rejected with a 429 status code.
4.  **Given** the server is running, **When** an administrator accesses the `/metrics` endpoint, **Then** Prometheus-compatible metrics are returned.
5.  **Given** a user's preferred language is set to French, **When** they receive a message from the server, **Then** the message is displayed in French.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if an OAuth 2.0 token expires mid-operation?
- How does the server handle a sudden disconnect and reconnect during an HTTP streaming session?
- What is the behavior when the circuit breaker is tripped for the Bitbucket API?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for client connections.
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement a user-configurable, priority-based authentication fallback logic. The default order shall be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the sensible default order? e.g., OAuth 2.0 -> Bearer Token -> API Key].
- **FR-003**: System MUST support Server-Sent Events (SSE) as a transport protocol.
- **FR-004**: System MUST support HTTP streaming as a transport protocol.
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement multi-language support for all user-facing strings.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001 (Security)**: System MUST use Helmet to set secure HTTP headers.
- **NFR-002 (Security)**: System MUST have a configurable CORS policy.
- **NFR-003 (Security)**: System MUST implement combined rate limiting (per IP address and per authenticated user) on all public-facing endpoints.
- **NFR-004 (Security)**: System MUST implement a circuit breaker pattern for outbound calls to the Bitbucket API that fails fast by default.
- **NFR-005 (Observability)**: System MUST provide advanced logging capabilities, including log rotation to local files with industry-standard policies.
- **NFR-006 (Observability)**: System MUST expose key performance indicators as Prometheus metrics.
- **NFR-007 (Performance)**: System MUST meet all performance SLAs defined in the project constitution under load testing.
