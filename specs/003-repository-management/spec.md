# Feature Specification: Repository Management

**Feature Branch**: `003-repository-management`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Repository management system with comprehensive Bitbucket API integration for repository operations"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the Bitbucket MCP server, I need comprehensive repository management capabilities so that I can create, configure, and manage repositories through MCP tools without switching to the Bitbucket web interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer wants to create a new repository, **When** they use the MCP repository creation tool, **Then** the repository should be created with proper configuration and permissions
2. **Given** a developer needs to list repositories, **When** they query the repository list, **Then** they should see all accessible repositories with relevant metadata
3. **Given** a developer wants to configure repository settings, **When** they update repository properties, **Then** the changes should be applied and validated
4. **Given** a developer needs to manage repository access, **When** they modify permissions, **Then** the access control should be updated correctly
5. **Given** a developer wants to clone repository information, **When** they request repository details, **Then** they should receive comprehensive repository metadata

### Edge Cases
- What happens when repository creation fails due to insufficient permissions?
- How does the system handle repository operations on deleted or archived repositories?
- What happens when repository settings conflict with workspace policies?
- How does the system handle large numbers of repositories in listing operations?
