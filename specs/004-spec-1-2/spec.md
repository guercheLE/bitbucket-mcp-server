# Feature Specification: Vector DB & Embedding Pipeline

**Feature Branch**: `004-spec-1-2`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "### Spec 1.2: Vector DB & Embedding Pipeline

- **FRs:**
  - Implement a script to generate embeddings from a small, representative subset of Bitbucket API documentation (5-10 endpoints).
  - Integrate the embedded vector database (`sqlite-vec`).
  - Package the pre-computed vector database file with the application distributable.
- **NFRs:**
  - **TDD:** Write and pass tests for the embedding generation and database loading process.
  - **Portability:** Ensure the database works out-of-the-box with no external dependencies."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25

- Q: Which embedding model should be used for generating the vector embeddings? → A: Use a pre-trained model from a library like Hugging Face (e.g., `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
- Q: How should the "representative subset" of Bitbucket API documentation be selected for embedding? → A: Embed all available operations/endpoints
- Q: What content should be used as the source for generating each embedding? → A: A structured JSON object containing operation name, endpoint, type, tags, schemas, a detailed description, and meaningful samples.
- Q: What should be the script's behavior if it fails to generate an embedding for a single API endpoint? → A: Log the error for that specific endpoint and continue processing the rest.
- Q: Is there a maximum acceptable size for the final, packaged vector database file? → A: No limit.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer, I want to create and integrate a vector database from all available Bitbucket API documentation so that the MCP server can perform semantic searches on it.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the complete set of Bitbucket API documentation, **When** I run the embedding script, **Then** a `sqlite-vec` database file is generated containing embeddings for all endpoints.
2. **Given** the generated vector database, **When** the application starts, **Then** the database is loaded and accessible without error.
3. **Given** the application is packaged, **When** it is distributed, **Then** the vector database file is included and has no size limit.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the API documentation is missing or in an invalid format?
- How does the system handle and log errors during the embedding generation process for a single endpoint?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a script to generate embeddings from all available Bitbucket API endpoints.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST use `sqlite-vec` for the vector database.
- **FR-003**: The generated vector database MUST be packaged with the application distributable, with no hard limit on its file size.
- **FR-004**: The embedding generation process MUST be covered by tests.
- **FR-005**: The database loading process MUST be covered by tests.
- **FR-006**: The integrated database MUST work without requiring external runtime dependencies.
- **FR-007**: The embedding script MUST log errors for failed endpoints and continue processing others.
- **FR-008**: The embedding process MUST use a pre-trained model from a public library (e.g., Hugging Face).

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: The final vector database should have no hard size limit.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **API Endpoint Embedding**: A vector representation of a structured JSON object. The JSON object MUST contain:
  - `operationName`: The name of the API operation.
  - `endpoint`: The URL path.
  - `type`: The HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST).
  - `tags`: Associated tags (e.g., repository, pullrequest).
  - `schemas`: Input, output, and error schemas.
  - `description`: A detailed explanation, including references to related operations.
  - `samples`: Meaningful usage examples.
- **Vector Database**: A `sqlite-vec` file containing the collection of API Endpoint Embeddings.
