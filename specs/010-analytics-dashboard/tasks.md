# Tasks: 010-analytics-dashboard

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/010-analytics-dashboard/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (completed)
**Dependencies**: ["001-mcp-server-infrastructure", "002-authentication-system", "003-repository-management"]
**Parallel Status**: [P] if can run in parallel, Sequential if not
**Allow Task Splitting**: false

## Phase 1: Setup and Foundation

- [ ] T001 [P] Create analytics module structure with types.ts, collectors/, aggregators/, storage/, and tools/ directories
- [ ] T002 [P] Define TypeScript types for analytics data structures (RepositoryMetrics, DeveloperMetrics, TimeSeriesData, ProjectHealthScore)
- [ ] T003 [P] Create base collector interface for repository data extraction

## Phase 2: Testing Framework

- [ ] T004 Create contract tests for analytics MCP tools (get-repository-analytics, get-developer-metrics, export-analytics-data)
- [ ] T005 Create unit test templates for analytics calculation functions
- [ ] T006 Create integration test framework for analytics data flow

## Phase 3: Data Collection Layer

- [ ] T007 [P] Implement repository activity collector (commit frequency, branch activity, lines of code changed)
- [ ] T008 [P] Implement pull request metrics collector (creation rate, merge time, review cycles)
- [ ] T009 [P] Implement developer productivity collector (commits, PR contributions, review participation)
- [ ] T010 [P] Implement code quality collector (test coverage trends, build success rates)

## Phase 4: Analytics Processing

- [ ] T011 [P] Create metrics aggregation service for combining collected data
- [ ] T012 [P] Implement time-based filtering and comparison functionality
- [ ] T013 [P] Create project health score calculation algorithm
- [ ] T014 [P] Implement analytics data persistence layer

## Phase 5: MCP Integration

- [ ] T015 Implement MCP tools for analytics operations (get-repository-analytics, get-developer-metrics, export-analytics-data)
- [ ] T016 Register analytics tools with MCP server
- [ ] T017 Add error handling and validation for analytics operations
- [ ] T018 Create analytics data export functionality

## Task Dependencies
- T004-T006 must complete before T007-T014 (TDD approach)
- T007-T010 must complete before T011-T013 (data before processing)
- T011-T014 must complete before T015-T018 (processing before MCP integration)
