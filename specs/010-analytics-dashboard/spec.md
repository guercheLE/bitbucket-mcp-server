# Feature Specification: Analytics Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `010-analytics-dashboard`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Analytics Dashboard - Comprehensive analytics and metrics dashboard for Bitbucket repositories, providing insights into repository activity, code quality metrics, developer productivity, and project health indicators"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a development team lead, I want to access a comprehensive analytics dashboard that provides insights into repository activity, code quality metrics, developer productivity, and project health indicators, so that I can make data-driven decisions about team performance and project status.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have access to a repository with commit history, **When** I view the analytics dashboard, **Then** I should see repository activity metrics including commit frequency, pull request statistics, and code churn metrics
2. **Given** I have multiple repositories in my workspace, **When** I access the dashboard, **Then** I should be able to filter and compare metrics across different repositories
3. **Given** I want to assess developer productivity, **When** I view the productivity section, **Then** I should see metrics for individual contributors including commits, pull requests, and code review participation
4. **Given** I want to monitor project health, **When** I view the health indicators, **Then** I should see metrics like test coverage trends, build success rates, and technical debt indicators

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a repository has no commit history or activity?
- How does the system handle repositories with very large amounts of data?
- What occurs when metrics cannot be calculated due to insufficient data?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
