# Feature Specification: Complete API Operation Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `007-spec-2-1`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "### Spec 2.1: Complete API Operation Implementation

- **FRs:**
  - Iteratively implement support for all 200+ Bitbucket API endpoints. For each endpoint:
    1.  Write the contract test against the official Bitbucket API.
    2.  Get test approval from the Project Lead.
    3.  Implement the internal operation logic in \`src/tools/operations/\`.
    4.  Ensure the implementation makes the test pass.
  - Generate and package embeddings for all supported endpoints.
- **NFRs:**
  - **Process:** This large-scale effort must strictly follow the TDD and approval workflow for every single endpoint.
  - **Pagination:** Ensure all list-based operations correctly implement and expose pagination."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. For each of the 200+ Bitbucket API endpoints:
2.   Write a contract test against the live Bitbucket API.
3.   Submit the test for approval by the Project Lead.
4.   ‚Üí If not approved: Block and await approval.
5.   Implement the operation logic in `src/tools/operations/`.
6.   Run tests until the new contract test passes.
7. After all endpoints are implemented:
8.   Generate embeddings for the entire set of supported operations.
9.   Package the embeddings into the application distributable.
10. Return: SUCCESS (all endpoints implemented and discoverable).
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25

- Q: The spec mentions a need for clarification on handling API changes. How should the system address an endpoint that is deprecated or significantly changed in a new Bitbucket API version? ‚Üí A: **Fail Fast**: The operation should fail with a clear error indicating it is deprecated or unsupported, requiring a manual update and new release.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer using the MCP server, I want to be able to discover and execute any of the 200+ Bitbucket API operations, so that I can build comprehensive automations for my development workflows without writing boilerplate code.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the server has implemented the "create pull request" operation, **When** a user executes `call-id` with the correct parameters for that operation, **Then** a new pull request is successfully created in the target Bitbucket repository.
2. **Given** the server has embeddings for all endpoints, **When** a user executes `search-ids` with the query "list repository branches", **Then** the tool returns the correct operation ID for the `GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/refs/branches` endpoint.
3. **Given** an operation that returns a paginated list (e.g., list commits), **When** the `call-id` tool is executed, **Then** the response includes pagination controls, and subsequent calls can retrieve the next page of results.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Bitbucket's API rate limits are hit? The system should handle the error gracefully and provide informative feedback to the user.
- How does the system handle endpoints that are deprecated or changed in a new Bitbucket API version? The operation MUST fail with a clear error message indicating that the endpoint is deprecated or no longer supported, requiring a manual update to the server's operation logic.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST iteratively implement support for all 200+ Bitbucket API endpoints.
- **FR-002**: For each endpoint, a contract test MUST be written that validates the server's implementation against the live Bitbucket API.
- **FR-003**: The contract test for each endpoint MUST be approved by the Project Lead before its corresponding implementation is merged.
- **FR-004**: The internal business logic for each API operation MUST be implemented within the `src/tools/operations/` directory.
- **FR-005**: Each implementation MUST ensure its corresponding contract test passes.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST generate and package vector embeddings for all supported API endpoints to make them discoverable via semantic search.
- **FR-007**: All operations that return list-based results from the Bitbucket API MUST correctly implement and expose pagination functionality to the client.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **API Operation**: Represents a single Bitbucket API endpoint. It encapsulates the endpoint's ID, HTTP method, path, and parameter schemas (e.g., Zod schema).
- **Contract Test**: An automated test that executes a specific API Operation via the MCP server and asserts that the interaction with the live Bitbucket API is successful and correct.
- **Embedding**: A numerical vector representation of an API Operation's documentation and metadata, used by the `search-ids` tool to find relevant operations based on natural language queries.
