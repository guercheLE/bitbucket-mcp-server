## Implementation Notes

### Issue Operations
- All tools support both Bitbucket Data Center and Cloud APIs
- Issue creation requires repository write permissions
- Issue listing supports complex filtering and sorting
- Issue updates validate permissions and workflow rules

### Security Considerations
- Issue access follows repository permission model
- Sensitive issue data is properly sanitized
- Audit trails track all issue modifications
- File attachments are validated for security

### Performance Requirements
- Issue listing supports pagination for large datasets
- Search operations are optimized for performance
- Bulk operations are implemented efficiently
- Caching is used for frequently accessed data

### API Compatibility
- Supports Bitbucket Cloud API 2.0
- Supports Bitbucket Data Center API 1.0
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features
- Backward compatibility maintained
