# Feature Specification: Issue Tracking

**Feature Branch**: `005-issue-tracking`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Issue tracking system with comprehensive MCP tools for Bitbucket issue management"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working with Bitbucket repositories, I need comprehensive issue tracking capabilities so that I can manage bugs, feature requests, and project tasks effectively through MCP tools.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer wants to create an issue, **When** they use the MCP tool, **Then** they should be able to create issues with title, description, priority, and labels
2. **Given** a developer wants to track issues, **When** they list issues, **Then** they should see filtered and sorted results with pagination
3. **Given** a developer wants to update issue status, **When** they use the update tool, **Then** they should be able to change status, assignee, and other properties
4. **Given** a developer wants to manage issue comments, **When** they use comment tools, **Then** they should be able to add, edit, and delete comments
5. **Given** a developer wants to link issues to code, **When** they use linking tools, **Then** they should be able to associate issues with commits, branches, and pull requests

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an issue is deleted while being viewed?
- How does the system handle concurrent issue updates?
- What happens when issue assignees are removed from the workspace?
- How does the system handle large numbers of issues in a repository?
