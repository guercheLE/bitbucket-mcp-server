## Implementation Notes

### Pull Request Operations
- All tools support both Bitbucket Data Center and Cloud APIs
- Pull request creation requires repository write permissions
- Pull request listing supports complex filtering and sorting
- Pull request updates validate permissions and workflow rules

### Security Considerations
- Pull request access follows repository permission model
- Sensitive pull request data is properly sanitized
- Audit trails track all pull request modifications
- File attachments are validated for security

### Performance Requirements
- Pull request listing supports pagination for large datasets
- Search operations are optimized for performance
- Bulk operations are implemented efficiently
- Caching is used for frequently accessed data

### API Compatibility
- Supports Bitbucket Cloud API 2.0
- Supports Bitbucket Data Center API 1.0
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features
- Backward compatibility maintained
