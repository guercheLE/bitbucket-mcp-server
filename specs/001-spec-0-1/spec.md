# Feature Specification: Spec 0.1: Governance & Project Setup

**Feature Branch**: `001-spec-0-1`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Spec 0.1: Governance & Project Setup"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25

- Q: How should branch protection rules on the `main` branch apply to repository administrators? ‚Üí A: Administrators can bypass all protection rules (e.g., force push, merge without checks).
- Q: What specific action should be taken if the CI/CD pipeline fails at any stage? ‚Üí A: Halt the process and require manual intervention to fix and restart the pipeline.

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a project administrator, I want to set up the initial project structure and governance to ensure a consistent and high-quality development process from the start.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new project, **When** the setup is complete, **Then** the repository will have a `main` branch with protection rules, a standard directory structure, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, and an architecture document.
2. **Given** the project is set up, **When** code is pushed, **Then** a CI/CD pipeline will run linting, testing, and code coverage checks, failing if coverage is below 80%.
3. **Given** the project is set up, **When** a developer commits code, **Then** commit messages must follow semantic conventions.

### Edge Cases

- If the CI/CD pipeline fails, the process is halted, requiring manual intervention.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST have a Git repository initialized with a `main` branch.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST have branch protection rules configured for the `main` branch. Administrators can bypass these rules.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST have the following directory structure: `src`, `tests`, `docs`.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST include a `LICENSE` file with the LGPL-3.0 license text.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST include a `CHANGELOG.md` file.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST have a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) with stages for linting, testing, and code coverage.
- **FR-007**: The CI/CD pipeline MUST fail if test coverage is below 80%.
- **FR-008**: If the CI/CD pipeline fails, it MUST halt the process and require manual intervention for a fix and restart.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: **Documentation:** The system MUST include an initial `README.md`.
- **NFR-002**: **Documentation:** The system MUST include an architecture document in `/docs` that outlines the 3-tool semantic discovery pattern.
- **NFR-003**: **Compliance:** The system MUST be configured with ESLint and Prettier to enforce code style standards.
- **NFR-004**: **Compliance:** The system MUST be configured to enforce semantic commit messages.
