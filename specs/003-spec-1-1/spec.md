# Feature Specification: Server & Connectivity

**Feature Branch**: `003-spec-1-1`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "### Spec 1.1: Server & Connectivity
*   **FRs:**
    *   Implement the basic MCP server that can start and stop.
    *   Implement `stdio` and `HTTP` transport protocols.
    *   Implement the Bitbucket connectivity service using Axios.
    *   Implement server type/version detection with fallback logic.
*   **NFRs:**
    *   **TDD:** Write implementation code to make the pre-approved tests for server startup and connectivity pass (Red-Green-Refactor).
    *   **Security:** Load credentials from environment variables and ensure logs are sanitized.
    *   **Test Coverage:** Achieve >80% line coverage for all code written in this spec."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: Of the following options, which best describes the expected behavior of the server in "degraded mode" when it cannot connect to Bitbucket? → A: The server continues running but rejects all API requests with a "Bitbucket not connected" error, while periodically retrying to connect in the background. When the connection is restored, it stops returning errors.
- Q: For the fallback logic when Bitbucket version detection fails, what should be the default assumption for the server's behavior? → A: Restrict functionality to a minimal set of common API features guaranteed across all versions.
- Q: When the HTTP port is already in use, the spec says the server should fail to start. What should be the retry behavior, if any? → A: Retry up to 3 times on the same port with a 5-second delay between attempts.
- Q: The specification states that on Bitbucket API rate limiting, the server should "log a warning." How should the server behave beyond just logging? → A: Immediately fail the request and return a `429 Too Many Requests` error to the client.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to start the MCP server so that it can listen for requests, and I want it to connect to a Bitbucket instance to prepare for API interactions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** the server is not running, **When** the start command is issued, **Then** the server starts successfully and listens on both `stdio` and `HTTP` transports.
2.  **Given** the server is running, **When** the stop command is issued, **Then** the server shuts down gracefully.
3.  **Given** valid Bitbucket credentials are provided as environment variables, **When** the server starts, **Then** it successfully connects to the Bitbucket API and detects the server version.
4.  **Given** invalid Bitbucket credentials, **When** the server starts, **Then** it logs a connection error, continues running, and rejects API requests while attempting to reconnect in the background.
5.  **Given** the server is in a degraded mode due to a connection failure, **When** the Bitbucket instance becomes available, **Then** the server automatically reconnects and resumes normal operation.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the HTTP port is already in use? The server should attempt to start 3 times with a 5-second delay and then fail with a clear error message if the port is still unavailable.
- How does the system handle Bitbucket API rate limiting? It should log a warning and immediately return a `429 Too Many Requests` error to the client.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a mechanism to start and stop the MCP server.
- **FR-002**: The server MUST support both `stdio` and `HTTP` for communication.
- **FR-003**: The server MUST establish a connection to a Bitbucket instance using the provided credentials.
- **FR-004**: The server MUST attempt to detect the Bitbucket server type (Cloud, Server, Data Center) and version.
- **FR-005**: The server MUST restrict functionality to a minimal set of common API features if version detection fails.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001 (Security)**: Bitbucket credentials MUST be loaded from environment variables.
- **NFR-002 (Security)**: All logs containing sensitive information MUST be sanitized.
- **NFR-003 (Testing)**: Implementation MUST follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.
- **NFR-004 (Testing)**: Code coverage for this feature MUST be above 80%.
