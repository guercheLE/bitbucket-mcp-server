## Dependencies Summary
**This feature depends on**: 002-authentication-system (webhook API authentication)  
**Features that depend on this**: 009-advanced-search (webhook-triggered indexing), 010-analytics-dashboard (webhook event analytics)

### Implementation Notes
- All webhook operations must follow secure coding practices
- Webhook URLs must be validated to prevent SSRF attacks
- Webhook payloads must be validated using cryptographic signatures
- Webhook delivery must implement proper retry and failure handling
- All webhook operations must support both Bitbucket Data Center and Cloud APIs
- Webhook configuration changes must be audited and logged
- Webhook processing must be performant and scalable
- Integration with existing authentication system is required

### Branch Merge Order
1. Complete webhook support implementation (Phases 1-6)
2. Merge to main branch
3. Webhook support becomes available for dependent features:
   - 009-advanced-search (webhook-triggered search indexing)
   - 010-analytics-dashboard (webhook event analytics and monitoring)
