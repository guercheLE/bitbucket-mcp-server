## User Stories *(guides implementation)*

### Epic: Webhook Management
**As a** developer integrating with Bitbucket  
**I want** to manage webhooks through MCP tools  
**So that** I can automate CI/CD and integration workflows

#### Story 1: Webhook Creation
**As a** repository administrator  
**I want** to create webhooks for specific repositories  
**So that** external systems are notified of repository events

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Can create webhooks with custom URLs and event filters
- Can specify authentication methods (secret tokens, SSL certificates)
- Can configure retry policies and timeout settings
- Can set webhook activation/deactivation status
- Can validate webhook URLs for security and accessibility

#### Story 2: Webhook Event Processing
**As a** system integrator  
**I want** to process webhook payloads with validation  
**So that** I can reliably handle Bitbucket events in external systems

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Can receive and parse webhook payloads in standard formats
- Can validate webhook signatures for authenticity
- Can filter events based on configured criteria
- Can transform payloads for downstream systems
- Can handle webhook delivery failures with retry logic

#### Story 3: Webhook Monitoring and Debugging
**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** to monitor webhook delivery status and debug failures  
**So that** I can ensure reliable integration workflows

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Can view webhook delivery history and success rates
- Can access webhook payload logs for debugging
- Can test webhook endpoints manually
- Can monitor webhook performance metrics
- Can troubleshoot failed webhook deliveries

## Technical Context *(implementation constraints)*

### Integration Points
- **Bitbucket Data Center API**: REST API 1.0 webhook endpoints
- **Bitbucket Cloud API**: REST API 2.0 webhook endpoints  
- **MCP Protocol**: Tool registration and execution framework
- **Authentication System**: Secure API access and webhook validation
- **Event Processing**: Real-time event handling and payload processing

### API Endpoints Covered
**Data Center (REST API 1.0):**
- `GET /rest/api/1.0/projects/{projectKey}/repos/{repositorySlug}/webhooks` - List webhooks
- `POST /rest/api/1.0/projects/{projectKey}/repos/{repositorySlug}/webhooks` - Create webhook
- `GET /rest/api/1.0/projects/{projectKey}/repos/{repositorySlug}/webhooks/{webhookId}` - Get webhook
- `PUT /rest/api/1.0/projects/{projectKey}/repos/{repositorySlug}/webhooks/{webhookId}` - Update webhook
- `DELETE /rest/api/1.0/projects/{projectKey}/repos/{repositorySlug}/webhooks/{webhookId}` - Delete webhook
- `POST /rest/api/1.0/projects/{projectKey}/repos/{repositorySlug}/webhooks/{webhookId}/test` - Test webhook

**Cloud (REST API 2.0):**
- `GET /2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/hooks` - List webhooks
- `POST /2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/hooks` - Create webhook
- `GET /2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/hooks/{uid}` - Get webhook
- `PUT /2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/hooks/{uid}` - Update webhook
- `DELETE /2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/hooks/{uid}` - Delete webhook

### Event Types Supported
- Repository events: push, fork, updated
- Pull request events: created, updated, approved, declined, merged
- Issue events: created, updated, commented
- Branch events: created, deleted, updated
- Tag events: created, deleted
- Build/Pipeline events: started, completed, failed

### Data Models
```typescript
interface Webhook {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  url: string;
  active: boolean;
  events: string[];
  configuration: WebhookConfiguration;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface WebhookConfiguration {
  secret?: string;
  contentType: 'application/json' | 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded';
  sslVerification: boolean;
  timeout: number;
  retryPolicy: RetryPolicy;
}

interface RetryPolicy {
  maxAttempts: number;
  backoffStrategy: 'linear' | 'exponential';
  retryInterval: number;
}
```

## Assumptions and Constraints *(project boundaries)*

### Assumptions
- Webhook endpoints are externally accessible and properly secured
- Target systems can handle webhook payload volumes and frequency
- Network connectivity is reliable between Bitbucket and webhook endpoints
- Webhook consumers implement proper authentication and validation

### Constraints
- Webhook URLs must use HTTPS in production environments
- Webhook payload size is limited by Bitbucket API constraints
- Webhook delivery attempts are limited to prevent infinite retry loops
- Webhook configuration changes require appropriate repository permissions

### Out of Scope
- Custom webhook payload transformation beyond standard formats
- Webhook proxy or relay functionality
- Webhook analytics and reporting dashboards
- Integration with specific third-party webhook consumers

## Success Metrics *(measurable outcomes)*

### Performance Metrics
- Webhook creation time < 2 seconds
- Webhook delivery success rate > 99%
- Webhook payload processing time < 500ms
- System support for 1000+ active webhooks per repository

### Quality Metrics
- Test coverage > 80% for all webhook operations
- Zero security vulnerabilities in webhook handling
- 100% API compatibility with both Data Center and Cloud
- Comprehensive error handling for all failure scenarios

### Business Metrics
- Reduction in manual integration setup time by 75%
- Improved CI/CD pipeline reliability through webhook automation
- Enhanced developer productivity through real-time notifications
- Increased system integration capabilities for enterprise users
