# Feature Specification: Basic Testing Framework

**Feature Branch**: `004-basic-testing-framework`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Basic testing framework with comprehensive test coverage for MCP protocol compliance"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the Bitbucket MCP server, I need a comprehensive testing framework so that I can ensure code quality, maintain protocol compliance, and prevent regressions as the system evolves.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer adds new MCP tools, **When** they run the test suite, **Then** protocol compliance tests should validate the tools follow MCP specifications
2. **Given** a developer modifies authentication logic, **When** they run tests, **Then** unit tests should verify individual functions work correctly
3. **Given** a developer integrates with Bitbucket APIs, **When** they run tests, **Then** integration tests should verify end-to-end workflows
4. **Given** a developer commits code, **When** CI runs, **Then** all tests should pass with required coverage thresholds (80%)
5. **Given** a developer wants to debug test failures, **When** they run tests in verbose mode, **Then** detailed error messages and stack traces should be provided

### Edge Cases
- What happens when MCP protocol specifications change and existing tests need updating?
- How does the framework handle flaky tests that depend on external services?
- What happens when test coverage drops below the required threshold?
- How does the framework handle tests that require specific authentication states?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide unit testing capabilities for individual functions and classes
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide integration testing for end-to-end workflows
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide contract testing for MCP protocol compliance
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate code coverage reports with configurable thresholds
- **FR-005**: System MUST support test mocking for external dependencies (Bitbucket API, authentication)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide test fixtures and utilities for common testing scenarios
- **FR-007**: System MUST support parallel test execution for performance
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear test failure reporting with actionable error messages
- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing
- **FR-010**: System MUST support test categorization (unit, integration, contract, e2e)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test Suite**: Collection of related tests organized by category (unit, integration, contract)
- **Test Fixture**: Reusable test data and setup code for consistent test environments
- **Test Mock**: Simulated implementations of external dependencies for isolated testing
- **Coverage Report**: Analysis of code coverage metrics including lines, functions, and branches
- **Test Runner Configuration**: Settings for test execution, coverage thresholds, and reporting
