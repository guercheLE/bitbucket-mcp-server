## Implementation Notes

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and workflows
- **Contract Tests**: Verify protocol compliance and API contracts
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user scenarios

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage across all categories
- 100% coverage for critical authentication and security functions
- Protocol compliance tests must cover all MCP specification requirements

### Test Execution Strategy
- Unit tests: Fast execution, no external dependencies
- Integration tests: Moderate execution time, mocked external services
- Contract tests: Protocol validation, schema compliance
- E2E tests: Full stack testing with real or test environments
