# MVP to Full Product Plan

**Project**: bitbucket-mcp-server
**Description**: A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for interacting with Bitbucket repositories, including repository management, code browsing, issue tracking, and pull request operations.

**Project Type**: Greenfield
**Analysis Date**: 2025-09-21

## Constitutional Requirements
- Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE) - Must implement Jest test framework first
- MCP Protocol First - Use official @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
- Multi-Transport Support - stdio, HTTP, SSE protocols
- Complete API Coverage - All Bitbucket Data Center (7.16+) and Cloud APIs
- Selective Tool Registration - Based on server capabilities

## MVP Features (Priority 1) - Core MCP Server
- [ ] **MCP Server Infrastructure** - TypeScript + MCP SDK setup, basic server structure
- [ ] **Test Framework Setup** - Jest test infrastructure (constitutional requirement)
- [ ] **Authentication System** - OAuth 2.0, App Passwords, API Tokens, Basic Auth
- [ ] **Repository Management Tools** - Core operations (list, create, get info, clone)
- [ ] **Code Browsing Tools** - Browse files, directories, get file content, commits
- [ ] **Issue Tracking Tools** - List, create, update, comment on issues
- [ ] **Pull Request Tools** - List, create, update, merge, comment on PRs

## Full Product Features (Priority 2) - Enhanced Functionality
- [ ] **Server Detection** - Auto-detect Data Center vs Cloud and version capabilities
- [ ] **Selective Tool Registration** - Load tools based on server type and version
- [ ] **Multi-Transport Support** - stdio, HTTP, SSE protocol implementations
- [ ] **Advanced Repository Operations** - Webhooks, branch restrictions, deployments
- [ ] **Pipeline Management** - CI/CD pipeline operations and monitoring
- [ ] **Console Client** - CLI interface for all MCP tools

## Full Product Features (Priority 3) - Advanced Features
- [ ] **Security Tools** - GPG keys, SSH keys, security scanning, permissions
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics** - Repository insights, dashboard data, usage metrics
- [ ] **Admin Tools** - System administration, user management, workspace config
- [ ] **Search Tools** - Advanced search across repositories and content

**Legend**: [P] = Can be developed in parallel

## Execution Plan
1. ‚úÖ Project analysis completed - Greenfield project identified
2. ‚úÖ Feature identification and prioritization completed
3. ‚úÖ Dependency graph created
4. üîÑ Execute workflow for each feature in dependency order:
   - Run `/specify` command with feature description
   - Auto-clarify spec using best judgment
   - Run `/plan` command for implementation plan
   - Run `/tasks` command for task breakdown
   - Create feature branches as needed

## Constitutional Compliance Status
- ‚ùå **Test-First Development**: Missing - Must implement first
- ‚ùå **MCP Protocol Implementation**: Missing - Foundation needed
- ‚ùå **Multi-Transport Support**: Missing - Advanced feature
- ‚ùå **Complete API Coverage**: Missing - Incremental implementation
- ‚ùå **Selective Tool Registration**: Missing - Enhancement feature

## Next Steps
Begin feature workflow execution starting with "MCP Server Infrastructure" as the foundation.
