# Feature Specification: {FEATURE_TITLE}

**Feature Branch**: `{BRANCH_NAME}`  
**Created**: {TIMESTAMP}  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "{FEATURE_DESCRIPTION}"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - MCP protocol compliance requirements (Article I)
   - Multi-transport support needs (Article II)
   - Server type detection requirements (Article III)
   - Tool registration and selective loading (Article III)
   - Complete API coverage requirements (Article IV)
   - Test-first development requirements (Article V)
   - Versioning and breaking change procedures (Article VI)
   - Simplicity and YAGNI principles (Article VII)
   - Library-first approach requirements
   - CLI interface and text I/O protocol needs
   - Integration testing with real dependencies
   - Logging and observability requirements
